This program aims at solving N Rooks and N Queen problem using DFS and BFS and compare the time complexities of both algorithms.

N-Rooks Problem Description
Given an empty NxN chessboard, place N rooks on the board so that no rooks can take any other, i.e. such that no two rooks share the same row or column.

N-Queen Problem Description
Given an empty N*N chessboard,place N queens on the same board so that no queens can take any other, i.e. such that no two queens ahre the saame row, column or diagonal.

To Run Program:
For N-Rooks:
python a0.py nrook <N> <UNAVAILABLE POSITION>
Example:python a0.py nrook 7 1 1

For N-Queens:
python a0.py nqueen <N> <UNAVAILABLE POSITION>
Example:python a0.py nqueen 8 1 2
