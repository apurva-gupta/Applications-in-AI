Title: To find POS tags of every word of a given sentence using hidden Markov model.

We have implemented this using three techniques viz.
a. Simple Naive Bayes Algorithm
b. Variable Elimination (Forward-Backward algorithm)
c. Viterbi Algorithm.

To Run Program:
./label.py part2 training_file testing_file
training_file and test_file contains word and corresponding POS tag for that word.
There is blank line to indicate the end of sentence.
